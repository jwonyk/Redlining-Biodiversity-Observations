# Redlining, Justice, and Biodiversity in LA

This project investigates how historical redlining in Los Angeles to today's enviromental and ecological patterns. We are going to use EPA's EJscreen data, Mapping Inequality Project data, and GBIF Bird Observations data to explore whether neighborhoods that were marked poorly by the HOLC would have any burdens and see the biodiversity sampling as well.

### Reflection

a.  Low Income

    -   We found that there is increasing trend of A to D and D areas have highest proportion of low-income residents and A. The redlining patterns indicate the economic disadvantages.

b.  Life Expectancy

    -   We found that there is increasing trend of A to D of lower life expectancy. The historically red-lined areas have lower life expectancy (C - D) than others (A - B). Long-term health disadvantages are shown.

c.  $PM_2._5$ Pollution

    -   Same as other data points, there is increasing trend of air pollution from A to D. Residents of C and D areas are more likely to be exposed to higher air pollution. The environmental burden and low socioeconomic shows likely connection to each other.

It is evident that historically worse neighborhood according to HOLC grade, the poorer outcome shows in socioeconomically and environmentally.

```

### Reflection

Q: Why might we have obtained different results in our analysis? What did the paper consider that we did not?

Our analysis of bird observations in LA between 2021 and 2023 shows that the bird data are uneven throughout the HOLC grade areas. The most significant difference from the Ellis-Soto et al. (2023) and our data is that our focus was only on the LA. In contrast, the paper investigated 195 cities with respect to a population greater than 30 million people in the USA. Their finding is that desirable, A and B areas, of metropolitan cities have more than twice the density of regions red-lined as "hazardous" areas. Our analysis differs from the start, as the paper uses a decade-long time period, whereas we are only focusing on a shorter time frame. Our sample could be biased for different reasons due to the limited data compared to the paper.
